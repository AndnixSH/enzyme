# Enzyme

Enzyme is an jailbreak-free iOS modding framework that allows you to statically patch and hook iOS apps. This repository contains an example using Enzyme. For modifying this, check out the CMakeLists.txt file, the patcher/main.py file, the patcher/bootstrap.asm file, and the src folder.

## Building Yourself

This Enzyme example requires that you provide an unzipped IPA file in the assets/IPA folder. For copyright reasons, you must provide your own. You must have CMake, Python 3, and an iOS SDK installed.
